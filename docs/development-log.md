## Status Update 1: 07th August 2019

1. Draft planning documentation has been reviewed to ensure that it meets the required standard. 

   ###### In Progress:

   - Sections on user interaction and experience, testing and help.
   - Preparing document for final submission.
     

2. Coding is almost complete with Main Menu, Recall existing, Generate New and Update existing password functionality written.

   ###### To Do:

   1. Delete existing password functionality.
      NOTE: minimal work required as this reuses code from other functions already written.
   2. Error handling to be finalised.

   ###### Additional tasks if time allows, otherwise to be revisited later:

   1. Request a user password be entered to access the Main Menu, hash the password and match it to the stored master password hash file to allow access.
   2. Decrypt the password file to enable processing, once the master password is successfully entered.
   3. Re-Encrypt the password file after the file is changed in any way.
     

3. Testing using Pytest is not yet started, although each individual function is being tested as a matter of course during the development phase.
